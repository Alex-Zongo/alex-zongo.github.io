📚 Hi, I am Alex.

I am a PhD student in the [**Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering**](https://mae.engineering.gwu.edu/) at  [**The George Washington University**](https://www.gwu.edu/), working under the supervision of Prof. [**Wei Peng**](https://web.seas.gwu.edu/pwei/) in the Intelligent Aerospace Systems Lab. 

My research interests center around solving complex sequential decision making problems via robust **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** algorithms, with key applications in the aviation industry. Specifically, I focus on advancing safe **multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)** for **aerospace systems**.

I hold a strong academic background in control science, engineering, and aircraft design from institutions including [**Tsinghua University**](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) and [**Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics**](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/).

Beyond my academic pursuits, I am committed to leadership development and community service, and I have a strong interest in music. 

For a comprehensive overview of my education, experience, and skills, visit my [CV page](/files/cv_updated.pdf).
