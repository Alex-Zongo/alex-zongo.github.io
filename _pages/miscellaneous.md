# Sports 🤾🏾

> **_Engaging in sports keeps both the body and mind sharp._**, as they say.
> I have a keen interest in handball, a sport that combines agility and teamwork. Being a wing player, I am also known as the **left handed magician 😉**. 
> Additionally, I dedicate time to gym and fitness routines to maintain strength and vitality. Nothing less than a morning or evening joggy to clear your mind and keep you in shape.

# Hiking 🥾⛰️

> **_Hiking is a cherished tradition within our research group, held every semester._**
> It offers a wonderful opportunity for team bonding, reflection, and reconnecting with nature.
> These excursions not only refresh the mind but also deepen our collective spirit, inspiring new perspectives and a shared appreciation for the outdoors.
