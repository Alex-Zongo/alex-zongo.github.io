# Introduction

Air Traffic Control (ATC) faces an increasingly complex challenge: managing dense airspace with growing traffic demand while maintaining strict safety standards. What if we could borrow principles from a seemingly unrelated field---fluid dynamics---to create more efficient and safer separation assurance systems?

In this post, I'll explore the fascinating analogy between aircraft flow in controlled airspace and fluid flow in confined domains, and demonstrate how computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques can inspire novel approaches to conflict detection and resolution. 

# The Fundamental Analogy
## Aircraft as Fluid Particles

Consider a controlled airspace sector as a three-dimensional domain, similar to a wind tunnel or pipe flow. Each aircraft can be conceptualized as a "particle"
